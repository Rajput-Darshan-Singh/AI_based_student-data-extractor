# PDF Result Extractor

A professional web application that extracts student result data from PDF documents using AI-powered text processing. The application provides a modern, user-friendly interface for uploading PDF files and downloading the extracted data as CSV files.

## Features

- ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Extraction**: Uses advanced AI models to accurately extract student information
- ðŸ“„ **PDF Processing**: Handles complex PDF layouts and formats
- ðŸ“Š **CSV Export**: Exports extracted data in a clean, structured CSV format
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Professional, responsive design with drag-and-drop functionality
- âš¡ **Real-time Progress**: Live progress tracking during processing


## Why this project?
My professor once mentioned how tedious it was to create semester divisionsâ€”she had to manually enter each studentâ€™s details into Excel and then sort them. To simplify this process and save her time, I built this project.


## Extracted Data Fields

The application extracts the following information from student result PDFs:

- **Name**: Student's full name
- **Registration**: Registration number
- **Total Marks**: Total marks obtained
- **SGPA**: Semester Grade Point Average
- **Grade**: Overall grade

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **AI Model Endpoint**: A running AI model server (e.g., Ollama with Llama3)
3. **Required Python packages** (install via requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this project to your local machine

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up AI Model** (if using Ollama):
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama (if not already installed)
   # Download and run Llama3 model
   ollama pull llama3
   ollama serve
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Using the Web Interface

1. **Upload PDF**: 
   - Drag and drop your PDF file onto the upload area, or
   - Click the upload area to browse and select a file

2. **Configure Endpoint**:
   - Enter your AI model endpoint URL (default: `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`)
   - This should point to your running AI model server

3. **Process**:
   - Click "Extract Results" to start processing
   - Monitor the real-time progress bar
   - Wait for processing to complete

4. **Download Results**:
   - Once complete, click "Download CSV" to get your results
   - The CSV file will contain all extracted student data

### API Endpoints

The application also provides REST API endpoints:

- `POST /upload` - Upload and start processing a PDF file
- `GET /status/<task_id>` - Check processing status
- `GET /download/<filename>` - Download processed CSV file
- `GET /cleanup/<task_id>` - Clean up temporary files

## Configuration

### Model Endpoint

The application supports various AI model endpoints. Configure your endpoint URL in the web interface or modify the default in `app.py`:

```python
model_endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"  # Ollama default
```

### File Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 16MB
- **Supported formats**: PDF only
- **Processing timeout**: Varies based on PDF size and complexity

## File Structure

```
webprojectAI/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Web interface template
â”œâ”€â”€ static/               # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/              # Temporary uploaded files
â””â”€â”€ outputs/              # Generated CSV files
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Model endpoint not responding"**:
   - Ensure your AI model server is running
   - Check the endpoint URL is correct
   - Verify the model is loaded and accessible

2. **"File upload failed"**:
   - Check file size (must be under 16MB)
   - Ensure file is a valid PDF
   - Check available disk space

3. **"Processing stuck"**:
   - Large PDFs may take several minutes
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Try with a smaller PDF first

4. **"No data extracted"**:
   - Verify PDF contains student result data
   - Check if PDF text is selectable (not scanned image)
   - Try different AI model parameters

### Performance Tips

- **Smaller files process faster**: Consider splitting large PDFs
- **Good internet connection**: Required for AI model communication
- **Sufficient RAM**: Large PDFs require more memory
- **SSD storage**: Faster file I/O operations

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Enable debug mode
export FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py
```

### Customizing Extraction

To modify the extraction logic, edit the helper functions in `app.py`:

- `clean_total_marks()`: Clean and parse total marks
- `extract_father_mother_names()`: Extract parent names
- `select_final_name()`: Choose the best student name
- `merge_students()`: Merge duplicate entries

### Adding New Fields

To extract additional fields:

1. Update the AI prompt in `extract_with_improved()`
2. Modify the JSON parsing logic
3. Update the CSV export columns
4. Add validation in helper functions

## Security Considerations

- Files are processed locally and not stored permanently
- Automatic cleanup removes temporary files
- No sensitive data is logged or transmitted
- File uploads are validated for type and size
